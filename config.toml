# TUME Email Client Configuration
# This is a skeleton configuration file with all available options.
# Uncomment and modify the values you want to use.

# ==============================================================================
# ACCOUNTS CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
# Define your email accounts here. Each account should have a unique key
# (e.g., "work", "personal", "side-project").
#
# To add an account, uncomment the section below and fill in your details:

[accounts.work]
name = "Work Gmail"           # Display name for the account
email = "work@company.com"    # Email address
provider = "gmail"            # Provider type (gmail, outlook, imap, etc.)
default = true                # Set one account as default (optional)
color = "blue"                # Color for visual indicators (optional)
display_order = 1             # Lower numbers appear first (optional)

[accounts.personal]
name = "Personal"
email = "me@gmail.com"
provider = "gmail"
color = "green"
display_order = 2

# Add more accounts as needed:
[accounts.side]
name = "Side Project"
email = "side@project.io"
provider = "imap"
color = "yellow"
display_order = 3

# ==============================================================================
# KEYBINDINGS CONFIGURATION
# ==============================================================================
# Customize your keybindings here. All settings are optional and will fall back
# to sensible defaults if not specified.

[keybindings]
# # Keys to switch directly to accounts 1-9
switch_account = ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]
#
# # Navigate between accounts
next_account = "]"            # Cycle to next account
prev_account = "["            # Cycle to previous account
#
# # Open mailbox picker (future feature)
mailbox_picker = "M"
#
# # Add new account wizard (future feature)
add_account = "A"

# ==============================================================================
# DEFAULT VALUES
# ==============================================================================
# If you don't specify any configuration above, TUME will use these defaults:
#
# Keybindings:
#   - switch_account: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9"]
#   - next_account: "]"
#   - prev_account: "["
#   - mailbox_picker: "M"
#   - add_account: "A"
#
# Note: Tab key also cycles to the next account (not configurable)

# ==============================================================================
